Reads an input consisting of a name and adds it to a queue until "End" is received. If you receive "Paid", print every customer name and empty the queue, otherwise we receive a client and we have to add him to the queue. When we receive "End" we have to print the count of the remaining people in the queue in the format: "{count} people remaining.".
