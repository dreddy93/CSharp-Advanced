Write a program that prints information about food shops in Sofia and the products they store. Until the "Revision" command is received, 
you will be receiving input in the format: "{shop}, {product}, {price}".  Keep in mind that if you receive a shop you already 
have received, you must collect its product information.
Your output must be ordered by shop name and must be in the format:
{shop}->
Product: {product}, Price: {price}
